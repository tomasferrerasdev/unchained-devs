          According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),
          67.8% of released state prisoners were arrested for a new crime within
          three years, and 76.7% were arrested within five. Reducing recidivism
          not only protects society at large, but also improves the life quality
          of individual ex-prisoners.
